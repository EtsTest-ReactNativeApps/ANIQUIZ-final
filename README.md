# **Final Aniquiz Project**

This is a repository that contains the development code for Aniquiz. Aniquiz is an offline based mobile quiz application that I have been developing by myself for last few month. The initial devleopment code for aniquiz is in quiz directory, which uses a Meteor.js backend.
However, as Meteor.js converts web apps to mobile apps using WebView, I decided to change it to ReactNative backend
for better native design integration for mobile and user experience. The UI was designed using Sketch and Invisionapp.

## **Features of Aniquiz**
   Here are some main features of aniquiz
   
   1. Card-stacks of quizes
   
      Each question in aniquiz is equivalent to a card, you simply click on the question and swipe after a question is complete.
      Once the cardstack is done, you will get your result!
      
   2. Different Modes
   
      Aniquiz has three different modes you can play on: Time, Standard, Survivial.
      Time mode requires you to finish the questions in time. Otherwise, you will lose the round.
      Standard mode is just a normal quiz mode.
      Survivial is one where you will be given all the questions in the aniquiz app and you keep going until you get one of the
      quizes wrong.
      
   3. Different question types
   
      It would not be fun if you just have some basic question types.
      So, I have a two other special question sets just for you! There are Character set and Music Set.
      
      For Character set, you will be asked to guess the character's name based on the silhouette of the character.
      You can click on the hint button to reveal the silhouette, but you are only given maximum 5 chances for the hints!
      
      For the Music set, as you probably expected, you will be given questions with music in the background and you will be
      asked to guess which anime does this music come from!
      
  So that is the summary of the features of aniquiz. Feel free to look at ReactNative code! It is based on Expo IDE, so if you want to
  run it you might have to download Expo to check it out.
